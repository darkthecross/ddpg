# DDPG to solve a self defined invert Pendulum problem

The pendulum environment was implemented using the Rungeâ€“Kutta method.

The ddpg implementation was based on [MorvanZhou's work](https://github.com/MorvanZhou/Reinforcement-learning-with-tensorflow/blob/master/contents/9_Deep_Deterministic_Policy_Gradient_DDPG/DDPG_update.py).
